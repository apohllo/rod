= ROD -- Read-only Data(base) 

* http://github.com/apohllo/rod

== DESCRIPTION

ROD (Read-only Data(base)) is library which aims at providing very fast
access for data, which rarely changes. 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* written mostly in C
* optimized for speed
* has nice Ruby interface which mimicks Active Record
* uses mmap for maximum speed (doesn't work on Windows)

== SYNOPSIS:

ROD is designed for storing and accessing data which rarely changes.
It is a opposite of RDBMS as the data is not normalized
It is a opposite of in-memory databases, since it is designed to cover 
out of core data sets (10 GB and more).

The primary reason for designing it was to create storage facility for
natural language dictionaries. The data in a fully fledged dictionary
is interconnected in many ways, thus the relational model (joins) introduces
unacceptable performance hit. The in-memory data bases, on the other hand,
would require the data to be kept mostly in the operational memory,
which is not needed, while processing text (in most cases only a friction
of the data is needed). That's why a storage facility which minimizes the
number of memory look-ups was designed. The Ruby interface facilitates it's
usage.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* RubyInline gem
* facets gem
* english gem

== INSTALL
