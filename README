= ROD -- Ruby Object Database

* http://github.com/apohllo/rod

== DESCRIPTION

ROD (Ruby Object Database) is library which aims at providing
fast access for data, which rarely changes.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* nice Ruby interface which mimicks Active Record
* Ruby-to-C on-the-fly translation based on mmap
* optimized for speed
* weak reference collections for easy memory reclaims
* segmented indices for short start-up time

* doesn't work on Windows

== SYNOPSIS:

ROD is designed for storing and accessing data which rarely changes.
It is an opposite of RDBMS as the data is not normalized.
It is an opposite of in-memory databases, since it is designed to cover
out of core data sets (10 GB and more).

The primary reason for designing it was to create storage facility for
natural language dictionaries and corpora. The data in a fully fledged dictionary
is interconnected in many ways, thus the relational model (joins) introduces
unacceptable performance hit. The size of corpora forces them to be kept
on disks. The in-memory data bases are unacceptable for larg corpora and
would require the data to be kept mostly in the operational memory,
which is not needed, while accessing dictionaries (in most cases only a friction
of the data is needed). That's why a storage facility which minimizes the
number of disk reads was designed. The Ruby interface facilitates it's
usage.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* RubyInline
* english
* ActiveModel

== INSTALL

Grab from rubygems:

  gem install rod

== BASIC USAGE:

 class MyDatabase < Rod::Database
 end

 class Model < Rod::Model
   database_class MyDatabase
 end

 class User < Model
   field :name, :string
   field :surname, :string, :index => true
   field :age, :integer
   has_one :account
   has_many :files
 end

 class Account < Model
   field :email, :string
   field :login, :string, :index => true
   field :password, :string
 end

 class File < Model
   field :title, :string, :index => true
   field :data, :string
 end

 MyDatabase.create_database("data")
 user = User.new
 user.name = 'Fred'
 user.surname = 'Smith'
 user.age = 22
 account = Account.new
 account.email = "fred@smith.org"
 account.login = "fred"
 account.password = "password"
 file1 = File.new
 file1.title = "Lady Gaga video"
 file2.data = "0012220001..."
 file2 = File.new
 file2.title = "Pink Floyd video"
 file2.data = "0012220001..."
 user.account = account
 user.files << file1
 user.files << file2
 user.store
 account.store
 file1.store
 file2.store
 MyDatabase.close_database

 MyDatabase.open_database("data")
 User.each do |user|
   puts "Name: #{user.name} surname: #{user.surname}"
   puts "login: #{user.account.login} e-mail: #{user.account.email}"
   user.files.each do |file|
     puts "File: #{file.title}
   end
 end

 User[0]                           # gives first user
 User.find_by_surname("Smith")     # gives Fred
 User.find_all_by_surname("Smith") # gives [Fred]
 File[0].user                      # won't work - the data is not normalized
